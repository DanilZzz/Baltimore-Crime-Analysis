# Baltimore-Crime-Analysis

Under impression from "The Wire" TV Show. But it would be interesting to see real crime image of Baltimore, especially violent crimes.
So, we have data about crimes from 01/01/2012 to 09/02/2017. Yes, this is another time period than "The Wire" action, but we'll have imagination about the level of crime probably in most dangerous city of the United States.
